The stylesheet that had grown to 5,354 lines is 801, combat's 1,867 is 767, and the kit that replaces them is 2,063 — one place to change how the game looks instead of many. It carries a batch of play-test fixes with it: combatant boxes are one uniform size (a tall enemy and a low one used to be drawn at different scales side by side), a fight's bottom row explains itself with tooltips on Actions, the piles and End Turn, the character screen shows what an attribute actually gives you instead of flavour text, the fullscreen and music controls sit anchored in the same corner on every screen, the co-op board no longer prints \"undefined\" over every enemy's intent, and the title lockup is centred.",

A blacksmith can now take a card out of the item that lends it, and the card is yours from then on; the mount it leaves is never dead, showing a fallback — the Dodge Roll for a weapon-art mount — until you seat another card in it. The Shrine gains Extract a Card and Seat a Card beside Upgrade, each the same reversible transaction the upgrade is: choose the item, then the mount, then (when seating) the card, with Back and Escape leaving the run untouched and Confirm the only thing that commits. A merchant rolls a 25% chance to have a smith with them, on its own die, so the roll does not disturb any other reward in a seed you have played. What is extractable is a tag on the card, the price and who offers the service are tables, and extra mounts sit behind a flag for a later rune feature. No shipped weapon authors a card package yet, so until content does, both options will tell you there is nothing to work on — the seam is live and the data is empty, as the bound table was before it.",

    "detail": "The class figure shown when you build a character, pick a style, or sit in the LAN lobby is now the painted concept design for that class, in place of the low-poly figure the Blender pipeline rendered. The Rogue changes most: its art was byte-for-byte the Reaver's, so the two classes looked identical and now do not. Your tint now colours the outfit, not just the outline. The garment takes the hue of the tint you chose while keeping the painting's own light and shadow, so the cloth changes colour without going flat; steel, bone and the dark inside a hood keep their own colour, because a dye does not touch those. The accent rim on the silhouette stays, so the figure that glows is still yours. Settings and the LAN lobby call this style Rendered, as before; its description now says \"The painted class figure\". In a fight you are now drawn as that same painted figure. Combat used to composite a low-poly Blender body in your armour set's colours, so the character builder showed one figure and the fight drew another in a different style — and the Rogue fought as the Reaver's shape repainted. The armour-set palette and the held-weapon overlay no longer show on the fighter; your weapons still show on your cards and in the Armoury. Enemy figures and act backdrops are unchanged too. These four figures were made with an AI image-generation model (ChatGPT Codex) — the game's AI disclosure and CREDITS say so, and the disclosure was rewritten and re-approved because the previous text said no image model had been used.",

That closed a real trap — the pile viewer had no exit a keyboard or a pad could reach at all. Modal widths come off four named sizes rather than a number typed per door, buttons in a row take one width from a four-step ladder, and a new gate measures whether anything bleeds out of its box on a real rendered page.",

Rests now open earlier than elites do, and a map that holds an elite holds a Shrine on some floor beneath it — measured across the generated maps, from 124 of 180 breaking that to none. The floor elites begin from has not moved, but the maps have: rolling a rest earlier changes what every node above it rolls, so a seed you have played before now draws a different map, elites included. What a run gains is about one more Shrine on the map, and the levels you buy at them are unchanged, because cinders were always the limit rather than the number of Shrines. The route is still yours: a path can climb past a rest and meet the elite anyway. Debug riders on the Custom Climb screen: the shortest act the slider offers is now 7 floors rather than 4, because a shorter act has no floor free to hold the promised rest.",
