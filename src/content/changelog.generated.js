    "summary": "Cold boot now opens on the Ashen Spire threshold",
    "detail": "The title menu now waits behind a sparse Ashen Spire wordmark, ash, and exact BUILD/source receipt until the first click, tap, Enter, Space, A/Cross, or Start/Menu press is completed. That first press is consumed instead of falling through into a save slot; interrupted presses are cancelled instead of surviving blur or controller disconnect, and the title then gives focus to its first available slot. The invitation follows the last active input family, exposes one named startup action without exposing title controls, profile recovery still takes priority, reduced motion keeps a short deterministic exit, and returning to the title during the same boot does not show the threshold again.",

    "detail": "Fullscreen and Music sit beneath the top-right HUD on the title, map, and combat screens, including LAN co-op. The Music control now reflects master Audio mute instead of claiming muted music is on, and turning it on releases both mute layers. Browser refusals are explained beside the control instead of disappearing into Settings, and iPhone users see the Add to Home Screen alternative without needing a hover tooltip. The in-run menu now contains only Settings and Controls, with Save Game and Save & Quit to Title in its footer; Profile lives on the title screen; Changelog lives under Advanced; and the old Deck and Stats shortcuts now open the Armoury that owns them without losing the active run’s combat totals. Restoring a profile also rebinds the title HUD immediately. The Profile drawer traps keyboard focus and states its real save-retention limits.",

One click on CARDS opens the strip, another folds it again, and outside a fight whatever you leave it on is what the Armoury gives you next time — it arrives the way you left it. The Armoury you open mid-fight keeps no such memory: it starts folded every time, whatever you did to it last.
