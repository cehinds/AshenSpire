# Approved wireframes: implementation

Reference: documentation commit `dcb3d1cd`, draft PR #1005. The owner requested
rebasing the implementation onto current dev after finding that the preview
used an old build. The branch now starts at `1b72522d`; the original
`09bda158` implementation commit was replayed as `18a44b28`. Existing work was
preserved. The owner’s unrelated primary checkout was not edited.

The subsequent merge preparation rebased onto `e017ef1d` (documentation-only
updates); the original implementation commit is now `b07b8747`. Runtime source,
tests, tools, and generated artifacts are byte-identical to the validated tree.
Implementation delivery is tracked in issue #1008.

## Coverage and current behavior

The adjacent `wireframe-coverage.json` lists all 152 approved entries and
separate structural, viewport, and interaction verification states. No entry
is complete yet. A component’s existence does not establish visual parity.

The shared card face now uses the approved 5:8 proportions, four bands, and
left cost rail. Live projections, X costs, and runtime registries still own
the values. The hand has uniform sizing, exclusive selection, instance-keyed
local reordering, and an inspection control outside the clipping scroller.
The inspector reuses real card details and domain actions.

Battlefield geometry uses fixed mirrored slots, front/back layering, equal
vertical ground-anchor intervals, role-specific guard anchors, and separate
selected growth. Existing sprite geometry and size-category ratios remain
authoritative. Shared modal footer actions use equal tracks.

## Reference reconciliation

- CURRENT-SPECIFICATION.md’s latest configuration governs accepted appearance;
  earlier hand fan and battlefield layout CSS is superseded.
- Current dev contains models and components missing from the old base. Reuse
  those runtime authorities; source paths in the reference are not evidence
  that a proposed adapter exists.
- Progression XP/practice examples do not authorize new mechanics. SPEC.md
  remains authoritative; do not turn illustrative reference data into gameplay.
- The hand/footer minimums leave insufficient readable battlefield height at
  844×390. The compact landscape appearance remains unresolved, not verified.

## Validation evidence and limits

Targeted card-cost, hand-layout, formation, and sprite-scale tests pass, as do
selection-store tests. The reference validator reports 152 entries and 608
views with no consistency failures; this is not runtime parity evidence.

Browser checks covered 1440×860, 375×667, 360×780, and 844×390. On iPhone SE,
selecting an adjacent card changed exclusive selection without spending an
action; its information control opened the real inspector, and Back restored
focus. Wide selection preserved the measured ground anchors and shared base
sprite scales. Compact landscape remains too compressed. Full drag/snapping,
all roster sizes, and all dependent screens still need browser verification.

Generated HTML was rebuilt with `node tools/launch.mjs --build-only`.
`verify-shipped` passed six checks and `buildversion --check` passed eight.
The first full Node run found two overlay coordinate writes that bypassed the
shared conversion helper. After converting them through `anchorLocalBox`, the
full Node rerun completed with exit code 0. Targeted zoom checks also pass.
Test logs and temporary images stay outside commits.

## Map: select, then Enter (classic act map)

Branch `feature/wireframe-map-bands`, based on dev `3c72a6df`. The owner
chose full W4b on both maps. This branch covers the classic act map, which
standard runs use; the world-journey atlas follows in its own branch.

- **Select, then Enter.** A tap on a lit node selects it; it no longer
  travels. Enter, or picking the selected node again, travels through the
  existing `enterNode` callback.
  - `src/ui/models/MapSelectionModel.js` owns the rule: an unreachable node
    is never selectable.
  - Keyboard and gamepad activation reach the same click path, so pressing
    confirm twice on a node also travels.
- **Context band (WGM4).** Below the scene, the band shows the selected
  node's floor, kind, and description from the same `NODE_TYPES` table the
  legend and tooltip read. It adds a boss destination and the Sealstone Key
  reveal when they apply.
  - Under fog it shows the kind the board drew, never the hidden one. The
    board now passes its own reading with each pick.
  - The band sizes to its content, up to 20% of the height.
- **Footer (WGM6, WGM7).** Recenter (the board's existing `resetFraming`)
  sits on the left and Enter on the right. Enter is disabled until a
  reachable node is selected and then names the kind.
- **Co-op.** The co-op map shares the board but keeps its own pick; nothing
  changes there.
- **Wording.** New text lives in `uiStrings.csv` (`map.*`).
- **Tools.** `tutorial-reach`, `offline-play-qa`, and
  `map-camera-persistence` now press Enter after selecting a node.

Browser evidence (emulation, `?shot=map`):
- At 1280×800 one tap selected the lone reachable node, filled the band
  ("Floor 1 · Monster · A fight — cinders and a card reward."), enabled
  "Enter Monster", and stayed on the map. Enter opened combat.
- At 390×844 the second tap on the selected node opened combat.
- At both sizes the footer is in view and the page does not scroll. The map
  takes 58% of the height at 1280×800 and 66% at 390×844.

Limits:
- The run HUD plus route strip still take about 17% rather than W4b's 10%
  header; narrowing them means redesigning the shared HUD.
- The zoom bar's ⊙ remains beside the footer's Recenter (the co-op map shares
  that bar).

## Remaining integration

Complete the card and hand interaction matrix, compact containment, combatant
inspection and roster stress cases; then integrate and verify dependent
screen shells, equipment, progression, rewards, and remaining overlays against
every coverage entry. No issue or draft implementation PR has been published
for these uncommitted changes.
