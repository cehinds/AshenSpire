# Approved wireframes: implementation

Reference: documentation commit `dcb3d1cd`, draft PR #1005. The owner requested
rebasing the implementation onto current dev after finding that the preview
used an old build. The branch now starts at `1b72522d`; the original
`09bda158` implementation commit was replayed as `18a44b28`. Existing work was
preserved. The owner’s unrelated primary checkout was not edited.

The subsequent merge preparation rebased onto `e017ef1d` (documentation-only
updates); the original implementation commit is now `b07b8747`. Runtime source,
tests, tools, and generated artifacts are byte-identical to the validated tree.
Implementation delivery is tracked in issue #1008.

## Coverage and current behavior

The adjacent `wireframe-coverage.json` lists all 152 approved entries and
separate structural, viewport, and interaction verification states. No entry
is complete yet. A component’s existence does not establish visual parity.

The shared card face now uses the approved 5:8 proportions, four bands, and
left cost rail. Live projections, X costs, and runtime registries still own
the values. The hand has uniform sizing, exclusive selection, instance-keyed
local reordering, and an inspection control outside the clipping scroller.
The inspector reuses real card details and domain actions.

Battlefield geometry uses fixed mirrored slots, front/back layering, equal
vertical ground-anchor intervals, role-specific guard anchors, and separate
selected growth. Existing sprite geometry and size-category ratios remain
authoritative. Shared modal footer actions use equal tracks.

## Reference reconciliation

- CURRENT-SPECIFICATION.md’s latest configuration governs accepted appearance;
  earlier hand fan and battlefield layout CSS is superseded.
- Current dev contains models and components missing from the old base. Reuse
  those runtime authorities; source paths in the reference are not evidence
  that a proposed adapter exists.
- Progression XP/practice examples do not authorize new mechanics. SPEC.md
  remains authoritative; do not turn illustrative reference data into gameplay.
- The hand/footer minimums leave insufficient readable battlefield height at
  844×390. The compact landscape appearance remains unresolved, not verified.

## Validation evidence and limits

Targeted card-cost, hand-layout, formation, and sprite-scale tests pass, as do
selection-store tests. The reference validator reports 152 entries and 608
views with no consistency failures; this is not runtime parity evidence.

Browser checks covered 1440×860, 375×667, 360×780, and 844×390. On iPhone SE,
selecting an adjacent card changed exclusive selection without spending an
action; its information control opened the real inspector, and Back restored
focus. Wide selection preserved the measured ground anchors and shared base
sprite scales. Compact landscape remains too compressed. Full drag/snapping,
all roster sizes, and all dependent screens still need browser verification.

Generated HTML was rebuilt with `node tools/launch.mjs --build-only`.
`verify-shipped` passed six checks and `buildversion --check` passed eight.
The first full Node run found two overlay coordinate writes that bypassed the
shared conversion helper. After converting them through `anchorLocalBox`, the
full Node rerun completed with exit code 0. Targeted zoom checks also pass.
Test logs and temporary images stay outside commits.

## Control roles and appearance

Branch `feature/wireframe-control-roles`, based on dev
`3c72a6df`. COLOR-INTERACTION-CONTRACT §3 now has one resolver,
`src/ui/models/ControlAppearance.js`. It applies the contract's precedence:
absent, then unavailable/busy, then destructive, then exit, then primary, then
utility/selection. Registered exceptions are validated by name.

- The kit `button()` stamps `data-control-role`, derived from its weight
  (a danger class is destructive), or from an explicit `role`. A registered
  `exception` is stamped as `data-control-exception`.
- Close (both shell builders), Back, Cancel, and Leave carry the exit role.
  They stay brown/gold at rest and turn red under pointer, keyboard, or pad
  highlight. A sole exit in the modal primary slot no longer receives
  primary green.
- `combatEndTurn` exception: a legal early End Turn stays neutral at rest and
  turns green while highlighted. Spent actions still mark it ready. Legality is
  unchanged.
- The positive (ready) colours now live in one set of
  `--control-positive-*` tokens.

WGH1 needed no change. `HUD_REFERENCE_MAX` (200/20/20) scales each track by
maximum/reference; the fill is current/maximum; there is no minimum track
length; `balance.ui.hudBars.main.scaleByMax` is on.

Not in this task: the nine size presets (WCB0). Grid button rows resolve
percentages against their own tracks, so presets need a workspace migration
that consumes them. They were not added as unused tokens.

## Remaining integration

Complete the card and hand interaction matrix, compact containment, combatant
inspection and roster stress cases; then integrate and verify dependent
screen shells, equipment, progression, rewards, and remaining overlays against
every coverage entry. No issue or draft implementation PR has been published
for these uncommitted changes.
