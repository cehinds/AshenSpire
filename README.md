**Feature branches:** every `feature/*`, `fix/*` or `chore/*` branch with an open pull request into `dev`, named with ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-` and `/` only, has a build at `https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/branches/<branch>/latest/`, which plays in a sandbox and does not keep progress (open ones are listed on [All builds](https://cehinds.github.io/AshenSpire/)); the pull request links it.
